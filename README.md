# Hello, I'm Stephen Kelly! 👋

I'm a recent graduate from Neue Fische's Data Science Bootcamp, actively enhancing my skills while looking for my first role in Data Science, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, or MLOps Engineering. With over a decade of experience as an Automotive Engineer developing Diesel Engines and Emissions Control Systems, I'm now excited to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills in the tech industry. I'm particularly passionate about Neural Networks & AI. 🧠💻

## 🚀 Skills

- **Programming languages:** Python 🐍, SQL, and basic MATLAB Simulink
- **Data Science tools:** Proficiency in Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and others.
- **Other skills:** Analytical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, project management

## 💡 Projects

Here is one of the key projects I've worked on:

- **NeuralXpresso** 📹: A capstone project developed with a team of fellow students at the Neue Fische Data Science Bootcamp. We developed a tool using neural networks to analyze video content to detect human faces, classify individual people, and visualize their emotions throughout the video. (Include the link to the project if available)
